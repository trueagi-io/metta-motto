For example, if a user asks you to solve the equation x^2−4*x−12=0, you should provide the solution as follows::
   Complete Solution

    Step 1: Recognize the type of equation.
        This is a quadratic equation in standard form:
        a*x^2+b*x+c=0


        For x^2−4*x−12=0, we have:

            a=1 (coefficient of x^2),
            b=−4 (coefficient of x),
            c=−12 (constant term).

   Vieta's formulas tell us that for a quadratic equation a*x^2+b*x+c=0, the sum and product of the roots x1 and x2 are given by:

    The sum of the roots:
    x1+x2=−b/a
    The product of the roots:
    x1⋅x2 = c/a

    Step 2: Find the magic numbers.
        Using the values of a, b, and c:

        The sum of the roots:
        x1+x2= 4/1 = 4

        The product of the roots:
        x1⋅x2 =−12/1 =−12

    Step 3: Solve the system of equations

        Now we need to find the roots x1 and x2, given the sum and product.

        x1+x2 =4
        x1⋅x2 = −12

These are two equations that we can solve by factoring. We need two numbers that add up to 4 and multiply to -12. The factors of -12 are:
1,−12; 2,−6; 3,−4; 4,−3; −1,12; −2,6.
The pair that adds up to 4 and multiplies to -12 is 6 and -2.
Thus, the roots are:
x1=6,x2=−2

Or another Example:
Example 1: A coin is thrown 3 times .what is the probability that atleast one head is obtained?

Step 1: Understand the problem

We need to find the probability of getting at least one head when a coin is thrown three times. 'At least one head' means that in the sequence of flips, there must be one or more heads.
Step 2: Define the sample space

    The sample space represents all possible outcomes of throwing the coin three times. Since each coin flip has 2 possible outcomes (Head or Tail), the total number of possible outcomes is:
    2×2×2=8
    2×2×2=8

    Thus, the sample space is:
    S=[HHH,HHT,HTH,THH,TTH,THT,HTT,TTT]
    S=[HHH,HHT,HTH,THH,TTH,THT,HTT,TTT]

    This gives us 8 possible outcomes.
Step 3: Identify favorable outcomes

    We are interested in the outcomes where at least one head is obtained. Let's count those:

        HHH (3 heads)
        HHT (2 heads)
        HTH (2 heads)
        THH (2 heads)
        TTH (1 head)
        THT (1 head)
        HTT (1 head)

    The only outcome without a head is TTT. All other outcomes have at least one head.

    So, the number of favorable cases is 7.
Step 4: Calculate the probability

    The probability of an event is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes. So, the probability of getting at least one head is:
    P(At least one head) = Number_of_favorable_outcomes/Total_number_of_outcomes = 7/8.

Alternative approach (complementary probability)

    Another way to solve this is to use the complement rule. The complement of getting 'at least one head' is getting 'no heads' (i.e., all tails). The probability of getting no heads (i.e., TTT) is:
    P(No heads)=1/8

    Now, the probability of getting at least one head is:
    P(At least one head)=1−P(No heads)=1−1/8=7/8
    Final Answer:

    The probability of getting at least one head when a coin is thrown three times is:
    P(At least one head)=7/8.


One more exampple:
Find the limit
of  (x^4+x^2-1)/(x^2 +5) if x ->1

Step 1: Substitute x=1 directly into the expression

    First, we can try substituting x=1x=1 directly into the expression to check if we get a defined value.

    For the numerator:
    x^4+x^2−1=1^4+1^2−1=1+1−1=1

    For the denominator:
    x^2+5=1^2+5=1+5=6

    So, substituting x=1 directly gives:
    1/6
Step 2: Conclusion
    Since the expression is well-defined and there are no issues like division by zero, the limit is simply:
    1/6.
